# Zeming Wei
I am a third-year undergraduate at School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University.
Currently, I am a visiting student at UC Berkeley.
I am interested in improving the trustworthiness of Machine Learning, specifically focusing on adversarial robustness and explainability.

## CFA: Class-wise Calibrated Fair Adversarial Training (CVPR 2023)
**Zeming Wei**, Yifei Wang, Yiwen Guo, Yisen Wang${}^\dagger$
- Theoretically and empirically investigate the preference of different classes for adversarial configurations in Adversarial Training (AT)
- Propose a CFA framework that customizes specific training configurations for each class automatically
- CFA improves both overall robustness and fairness, and can be easily incorporated into other AT variants
- [[pdf](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Wei_CFA_Class-Wise_Calibrated_Fair_Adversarial_Training_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf)] [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14460)] [[code](https://github.com/PKU-ML/CFA)]

## Sharpness-Aware Minimization Alone can Improve Adversarial Robustness (ICML 2023 Workshop)
**Zeming Wei\*${}^{\boldsymbol\dagger}$**, Jingyu Zhu\*, Yihao Zhang\*
- Theoretically show that using Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) can improve adversarial robustness
- Empirically illustrate that SAM can improve robustness with a friendly computational cost and no decrease in natural accuracy
- Propose that SAM can be regarded as a lightweight substitute for AT under certain requirements

## Extracting Weighted Finite Automata from Recurrent Neural Networks for Natural Languages (ICFEM 2022)
**Zeming Wei**, Xiyue Zhang, Meng Sun${}^\dagger$
- Identify the transition sparsity and the context dependency problem in WFA extraction from RNNs in natural language tasks
- Propose an extraction approach that complements the missing rules and enhances the context-aware ability
- Our extraction framework is scalable to natural language tasks and of better extraction precision

## Weighted Automata Extraction and Explanation of Recurrent Neural Networks for Natural Language Tasks (Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming)
**Zeming Wei**, Xiyue Zhang, Yihao Zhang, Meng Sun${}^\dagger$
- Extended version for ICFEM 2022 paper
- Propose explaining Recurrent Neural Networks by the extracted automata with a transition-based word embedding
- Further propose two applications (pertaining and adversarial attack) of the embedding
