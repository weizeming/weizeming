# Zeming Wei
I am a third-year undergraduate at School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University.
Currently, I am a visiting student at UC Berkeley.
I am interested in improving the trustworthiness of Machine Learning, specifically focusing on adversarial robustness and explainability.

## Jailbreak and Guard Aligned Language Models with Only Few In-Context Demonstrations (Preprint)
**Zeming Wei**, Yifei Wang, Yisen Wang ${}^\dagger$
- Uncover the vulnerability and robustness of aligned language models under only few in-context demonstrations without fine-tuning
- Propose In-Context Attack (ICA) and In-Context Defense (ICD) to jailbreak and guard aligned language models
- Shed light on the potential of in-context learning (ICL) to manipulate the alignment of LLMs

## CFA: Class-wise Calibrated Fair Adversarial Training (CVPR 2023)
**Zeming Wei**, Yifei Wang, Yiwen Guo, Yisen Wang ${}^\dagger$
- Theoretically and empirically investigate the preference of different classes for adversarial configurations in Adversarial Training (AT)
- Propose a CFA framework that customizes specific training configurations for each class automatically
- CFA improves both overall robustness and fairness, and can be easily incorporated into other AT variants

## Sharpness-Aware Minimization Alone can Improve Adversarial Robustness (ICML 2023 Workshop)
**Zeming Wei\* ${}^{\boldsymbol\dagger}$**, Jingyu Zhu\*, Yihao Zhang\*
- Theoretically show that using Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) can improve adversarial robustness
- Empirically illustrate that SAM can improve robustness with a friendly computational cost and no decrease in natural accuracy
- Propose that SAM can be regarded as a lightweight substitute for AT under certain requirements

## Weighted Automata Extraction and Explanation of Recurrent Neural Networks for Natural Language Tasks (Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming)
**Zeming Wei**, Xiyue Zhang, Yihao Zhang, Meng Sun ${}^\dagger$
- Extending WFA extraction methods of RNNs from formal to natural language tasks by identifying transition sparsity and context dependency problems
- Propose an RNN interpretation framework with a transition-based word embedding of the extracted automata  
- Further propose two applications (pretraining and adversarial attack) on RNNs with the embedding
